<b>FindMe</b> is a fun and engaging mobile application that challenges users to guess locations based on photos posted by others. It combines social interaction with a gaming twist, as players navigate through a map to pinpoint the exact spot of the uploaded photo. The game tests geographical knowledge and offers a fun way to learn about new places!

This is a project made for the 2022-2023 course on [Mobile Applications and Cloud Computing](https://sites.google.com/diag.uniroma1.it/beraldi/mobile-applications-and-cloud-computing-23).

## Features

- <b>Photo Sharing</b>: Users can upload photos of their current locations.
